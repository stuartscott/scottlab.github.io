title: The <em>CYP2D6</em> VCF TRANSLATOR
home: |
  The ***CYP2D6* variant call format (VCF) Translator** v1.0 converts *CYP2D6* sequence variants from human genome assembly GRCh37/hg19 coordinates to the [M33388.1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/M33388) and [AY545216.1](AY545216) GenBank reference sequence coordinates, which are commonly used for *CYP2D6* star (*) allele conversion.

  **Key features:**

  - The input is a standard VCF file (.vcf) with a file head and 10 columns (#CHROM, POS, ID, REF, ALT, QUAL, FILTER, INFO, FORMAT, SAMPLE) limited to the full gene *CYP2D6* coordinates from human genome reference hg19 (chr22:42522071-42528563).
  - The [M33388.1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/M33388) and [AY545216.1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AY545216) GenBank reference sequences have been modified to include the *CYP2D6* nucleotide corrections indicated by the [Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Allele Nomenclature Database](http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp2d6.htm).
  - Corrects for the *CYP2D6&#42;2* haplotype variants present in the hg19 human genome reference build (e.g., intron 1 conversion, 1661G>C, 2850C>T, 4180G>C, etc.).
  - Converts variants to their reverse complement as the *CYP2D6* gene is encoded on the negative strand.
  - Coordinates and variant annotation can be downloaded as a tab delimited .txt file.

    1. Click 'Choose File' to identify and select a local VCF file (.vcf).
    2. Click 'Run'.
    3. Click 'Open Result in New Tab' to view the results onscreen or select 'Download Result' to download the .txt results file to a local drive.

    **Notes:**

    - The #CHROM, POS, and SAMPLE columns of a VCF file are essential to run the ***CYP2D6* VCF Translator.**
    - The input range of the POS field is limited to the *CYP2D6* full gene and flanking region coordinates from human genome reference **[GRCh37/hg19 (chr22:42522071-42528563)](http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg19&position=chr22%3A42522071-42528563&hgsid=452868401_q42AOxxCDdLcq5dlu6TtOgJ8JG3C)**.
    - The *CYP2D6* gene sequence of the hg19 genome reference build contains many common *CYP2D6&#42;2* variants.  These variants will be homozygous reference in a VCF (and therefore not called) if they are actually homozygous for the minor allele in a sequenced sample.  These variants could also be absent from a VCF file if they are outside of your sequenced region.  Therefore, all *CYP2D6&#42;2* variants not called in a VCF are annotated in the output file as ‘Mutant or Not Sequenced’.
